# Personal Website API
Backend API for my personal website UI. This is a work in progress. Still need to enable HTTPS and make changes to use a different datasource (something other than H2). Also, need to update this readme a lot more.

Open SSL command to create a random base 64 string of specified size (in the example below, 32 bytes):
```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```
